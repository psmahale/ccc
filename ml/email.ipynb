    "# This program performs Email Spam Detection using two machine learning algorithms:\n",
    "# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). \n",
    "# The main goal is to classify whether an incoming email is spam or not based on its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# First, the program loads the dataset 'emails.csv' using pandas. \n",
    "# This dataset contains various numeric features that represent word frequencies, \n",
    "# character frequencies, or other text-based metrics extracted from emails. \n",
    "# It also includes a target column named 'Prediction' which indicates \n",
    "# whether the email is spam (1) or not spam (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "# After loading, unnecessary columns like 'Email No.' (if present) are dropped to clean the data. \n",
    "# The remaining data is then split into two parts: \n",
    "# features (X) which contain the independent variables, \n",
    "# and label (y) which contains the dependent variable (spam or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "# The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets \n",
    "# using train_test_split(), with 80% data for training the model \n",
    "# and 20% for testing. This ensures that the model can be trained \n",
    "# and then evaluated on unseen data for fair accuracy measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The first algorithm used is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). \n",
    "# KNN works on the concept of similarity — when a new email is given, \n",
    "# it checks the 'k' closest data points (here k=5) \n",
    "# from the training dataset and predicts the label \n",
    "# based on the majority of those neighbors. \n",
    "# The KNN model is trained using knn.fit() and tested using knn.predict().\n",
    "\n",
    "# The second algorithm is Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. \n",
    "# SVM finds the best hyperplane that separates spam and non-spam emails \n",
    "# in a multi-dimensional feature space. \n",
    "# It tries to maximize the margin between both classes for better classification. \n",
    "# The model is trained using svm.fit() and predictions are made using svm.predict().\n",
    "\n",
    "# After training both models, the program evaluates their performance. \n",
    "# For both KNN and SVM, it calculates Accuracy, Classification Report, \n",
    "# and Confusion Matrix using sklearn.metrics. \n",
    "# The accuracy tells the overall correctness of the model, \n",
    "# while the classification report provides detailed metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. \n",
    "# The confusion matrix helps visualize how many emails were correctly and incorrectly \n",
    "# classified as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finally, both models’ results are printed and compared. \n",
    "# Usually, SVM performs slightly better than KNN for text-based datasets \n",
    "# because it handles high-dimensional data efficiently. \n",
    "# The code thus demonstrates a clear comparison of two classical \n",
